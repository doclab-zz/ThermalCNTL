%% Learning PID Tuning II: Stability Margin
% The PID controller is the most widely used controller in various
% engineering systems. However, appropriately tuning a PID controller is
% not an easy task althrough it has only three parameters at most. The
% difficulty particially comes from some comfilict requirements of control
% system performance and partially is due to complicated impacts of PID
% parameters on control performance. This submission provides the second
% tutorial on PID tuning using the stability margin.
%
%% Ziegler-Nichols Tuning Rule
% Ziegler-Nichols tuning rule was the first such effort to provide a
% practical approach to tune a PID controller. According to the rule, a PID
% controller is tuned by firstly setting it to the P-only mode but adjusting
% the gain to make the control system in continuous oscillation. The
% corresponding gain is referred to as the ultimate gain (Ku) and the
% oscillation period is termed as the ultimated period (Pu). Then, the PID
% controller parameters are determined from Ku and Pu using the
% Ziegler-Nichols tuning table.

%% Determine the Ultimate Gain and Period
% The key step of the Ziegler-Nichols tuning approach is to determine the
% untimate gain and period. However, to determine the ultimate gain and
% period experimentally is time comsuming. Since the continuous oscillation
% mode correcponds to the critical stable condition, for linear systems,
% such a condition can be easily determined through stability margins.
% Other tools, such as the Routh criterion and the Evans root locus, cannot
% deal with a time-delay directly.
% 
% Let the plant have gain margin Gm at crossover frequency Wcg. This
% equivalent to connect with a unit gain controller. Therefore, if the
% controller gain increases by Gm, then the system will oscillate at
% frequency Wcg. Therefore, Ku and Pu can be determined from Gm and Wcg as
% follows:
%
% $$K_u=G_m$$
%
% or
%
% $$20\log_{10}(K_u) = G_m (dB)\,\, \Rightarrow\,\, K_u=10^{Gm/20}$$ 
%
% $$P_u=\frac{2\pi}{\omega_{cg}}$$
%
%% Example: PI controller for a first-order plus time-delay system
% The plant has a unit gain, time constant 10 and time delay 2
T=10;
dt=2;
G=tf(1,[T 1]);
G.InputDelay=dt;
% use the Ziegler-Nichols PID design tool
[k,ku,pu]=znpidtuning(G,2); 
% verify Ku and Pu using step response of G*ku in 5 periods
step(feedback(ss(G*ku),1),5*pu)

%% Closed-loop step response
% the PI controller transfer function
C=k.kc*(1+tf(1,[k.ti 0]));
% get the closed-loop model in state space form since MATLAB/Control Toolbox
% support time-delay only in state-space form. 
H=minreal(feedback(ss(G*C),1));
% closed-loop step response
step(H)

%% Closed-loop performance comparison
% The above result is compared with the PI controller tuned based on the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=16661&objectType=FILE Process Reaction Curve Appraoch.> 
% The PI parameters from this approach are as follows:
kc=0.9*T/(1*dt);
ti=3.33*dt;
C1=kc*(1+tf(1,[ti 0]));
H1=minreal(feedback(ss(G*C1),1));

%% Conclusion
% For this particular example, the stability margin based tuning results a
% smaller overshooting but slightly slower response.
